I had a hard time finding logistic regression examples that actually worked wtih my version of RStudio including R bloggers and some other website I forgot the name of that used the same data set. 
Version 1.1.383 – © 2009-2017 RStudio, Inc.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64) AppleWebKit/538.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) rstudio Safari/538.1 Qt/5.4.1

I typed it out, but 99.9% of this was done using this website
